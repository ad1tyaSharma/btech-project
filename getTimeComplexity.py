#To determine the time complexity of the algorithm, we can plot the execution time as a function of the input size, and analyze the slope of the resulting curve. For example, if the execution time increases linearly with the input size, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the input size. If the execution time increases quadratically with the input size, the time complexity is O(n^2), and so on.
